once in a village there were 2 dogs

they were passing through a narrow bridge 
in which only one can move first 
both were coming form 2 ends of bridge , when both came at centre ,both started fighting for who will go first,
as fight started both fell into the river

after sometime 2 goats came from 2 end of bridge
both came at centre , they didnt fight instead one sat down so that other can jump fom it an go
both then crossed the bridge
